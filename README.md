## Introduction

This document is a guide for the SDK provided to help develop devices based on the LSM100A LoRa/Sigfox module of Seongji.

The LSM100A is a state-of-art module integrating STMicroelectronics’ STM32WL. 
It is very less current consumption for IoT device to extend battery life. 
And, it also supports both of technologies – Sigfox and LoRa – with LSM100A module itself. 

You can switch Sigfox or LoRa with it so that you can also reduce cost. 
It is highly optimized for IoT solution (Low-Power Consumption, Low-Cost)

For other information, please refer to the document in Document.

## SDK Build

- ST Software Development Tools
  + STM32CubeIDE <br/>
    * Download link: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

	* Document link: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#documentation

<br/>

###	Build using the STM32CubeIDE <br/>

  1. Execute the .project file in Projects\NUCLEO-WL55CC\Applications\LoRaWAN_Sigfox\LSM100A\STM32CubeIDE folder. <br/>

  2. After STM32CubeIDE is executed, LSM100A_SDK_LoRaWAN_Sigfox project is created in the left Project Explorer tab. <br/>
    The program name is subject to change. <br/>

  3. Run Build All from the Project menu.
    After the build is completed, a hex file is created in the Release folder. <br/>

**From the June 2, 2022 update version, IAP (Bootloader) has been applied.**

**First of all, you need to download IAP (Bootloader).**
**Refer to the ReadMe.md file of Utilities/1_SJITools/1_FW_Merge_Tool to generate and download FW including IAP for FW generated by building SDK.**
